Well, do some comments here

0. Some includes which may be useful:

    #include <QCoreApplication>
    #include <QTextStream>

/*********************************/


1. First of all, some reading from console with QTextStream

        input:

        QTextStream in(stdin);
        QString value;
        in >> value;

        output:

        QTextStream out(stdout);
        out << value;
        out << '\n';
        out.flush();

I'll figure out it later.
upd: it became obvious that I'll use c++ string because of tinyxml which uses it.

2. Secondly, wat? What it is, how does it work?

    QCoreApplication app(argc, argv);
    app.exit(0);
    return (app.exec());
